## **1. Mixing and Outdated compiler**

The pragma version used are:

```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
pragma solidity >=0.6.0;
pragma solidity >=0.7.5;
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

*Note that mixing pragma is not recommended. Because different compiler versions have different meanings and behaviors, it also significantly raises maintenance costs. As a result, depending on the compiler version selected for any given file, deployed contracts may have security issues.*

The minimum required version must be [0.8.17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.17); otherwise, contracts will be affected by the following **important bug fixes**:

[0.8.3](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/03/23/solidity-0.8.3-release-announcement/):

- Optimizer: Fix bug on incorrect caching of Keccak-256 hashes.

[0.8.4](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/solidity-0.8.4-release-announcement/):

- ABI Decoder V2: For two-dimensional arrays and specially crafted data in memory, the result of abi.decode can depend on data elsewhere in memory. Calldata decoding is not affected.

[0.8.9](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/09/29/solidity-0.8.9-release-announcement/):

- Immutables: Properly perform sign extension on signed immutables.
- User Defined Value Type: Fix storage layout of user defined value types for underlying types shorter than 32 bytes.

[0.8.13](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement/):
- Code Generator: Correctly encode literals used in `abi.encodeCall` in place of fixed bytes arguments.

[0.8.14](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/18/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement/):

- ABI Encoder: When ABI-encoding values from calldata that contain nested arrays, correctly validate the nested array length against `calldatasize()` in all cases.
- Override Checker: Allow changing data location for parameters only when overriding external functions.

[0.8.15](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement/)

- Code Generation: Avoid writing dirty bytes to storage when copying `bytes` arrays.
- Yul Optimizer: Keep all memory side-effects of inline assembly blocks.

[0.8.16](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/08/08/solidity-0.8.16-release-announcement/)

- Code Generation: Fix data corruption that affected ABI-encoding of calldata values represented by tuples: structs at any nesting level; argument lists of external functions, events and errors; return value lists of external functions. The 32 leading bytes of the first dynamically-encoded value in the tuple would get zeroed when the last component contained a statically-encoded array.

[0.8.17](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/09/08/solidity-0.8.17-release-announcement/)

- Yul Optimizer: Prevent the incorrect removal of storage writes before calls to Yul functions that conditionally terminate the external EVM call.

Apart from these, there are several minor bug fixes and improvements.

## **2. Unsafe safe library**

The library used for safe ERC20 calls, is prone to a known attack.

Recently there was one of the biggest hacks (https://certik.medium.com/qubit-bridge-collapse-exploited-to-the-tune-of-80-million-a7ab9068e1a0) in crypto, 80m$ was lost.

> One of the root causes of the vulnerability was the fact that tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom() does not revert when the tokenAddress is the zero (null) address (0x0â€¦000).

The audited contract doesn't use the last SafeERC20 version of openZeppelin; that library fixes the issue by checking that the `token` is a contract, instead of an EOA. It used a vulnerable version which doesn't check the kind of address. So the method `safeTransferFrom`, and `safeTransfer` doesn't check if `token` is a contract, only return value if it's different than 0.

The following methods are vulnerable to this:
- `safeTransferFrom`
- `safeTransfer`
- `safeApprove`
- `safeTransferETH`

Poc:
- Call this method with an EOA as a token, it will work.

*All of these calls are prone to lack of funds or wrong deposits.*

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

- It's mandatory to check if the address is a contract.
- Use the last version of OpenZeppelin contracts, check that `token` is a contract and always check the returned value.

**Affected source code:**

- [TransferHelper.sol:6](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project/blob/fc8589d7d8c1d8488fd97ccc46e1ff11c8426ac2/router-v1/contracts/libraries/TransferHelper.sol#L6)

## **3. Lack of checks `address(0)`**

The following methods have a lack of checks if the received argument is an address, it's good practice in order to reduce human error to check that the address specified in the constructor or initialize is different than `address(0)`.

**Affected source code:**

- [Router.sol:49-51](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project/blob/fc8589d7d8c1d8488fd97ccc46e1ff11c8426ac2/router-v1/contracts/Router.sol#L49-L51)

## **5. Integer overflow by unsafe casting**

Keep in mind that the version of solidity used, despite being greater than `0.8`, does not prevent integer overflows during casting, it only does so in mathematical operations.

It is necessary to safely convert between the different numeric types.

**Recommendation:**

Use a [safeCast](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#SafeCast) from Open Zeppelin.

```javascript
twa.updateValue(currentState.activeTick * PRBMathSD59x18.SCALE + int256(Math.clip(delta.endSqrtPrice, delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice).div(delta.sqrtUpperTickPrice - delta.sqrtLowerTickPrice)));
```

# Non critical

## **6. Start with the token Id 0**

The id 0 is a valid valid id and the current logic starts the ERC721 with 1, it is convenient to study if it is more convenient to start with the id 0.

**Affected source code:**

- [Position.sol:20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-Stealth-Project/blob/fc8589d7d8c1d8488fd97ccc46e1ff11c8426ac2/maverick-v1/contracts/models/Position.sol#L20)

## **7. Use libraries instead of abstract contracts**

The logic of the functions detailed below have been defined within an abstract contract instead of in a library, in order to reduce inheritance and ease readability, as well as update gap issues (in case of happened), it is convenient. use libraries to define reusable functions.

**Affected source code:**

## **8. Unify design**

The Owner logic has been created entirely in the `Factory` contract, however in other contracts such as `PositionMetadata` or `Position` it extends from `Ownable`, the design of the contracts should be unified.
