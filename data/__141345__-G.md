#### Variable re-arrangement by storage packing

In `struct Instance`, `bool tokenAIn` can be placed after `uint256 endSqrtPrice`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, `bool tokenAIn` can be packed into 1 slot with the later 4 bool variables.

```solidity
File: maverick-v1/contracts/libraries/Delta.sol
05:     struct Instance {
06:         uint256 deltaInBinInternal;
07:         uint256 deltaInErc;
08:         uint256 deltaOutErc;
09:         uint256 excess;
10:         bool tokenAIn;
11:         uint256 endSqrtPrice;
12:         bool exactOutput;
13:         bool swappedToMaxPrice;
14:         bool skipCombine;
15:         bool decrementTick;
16:         uint256 sqrtPriceLimit;
17:         uint256 sqrtLowerTickPrice;
18:         uint256 sqrtUpperTickPrice;
19:         uint256 sqrtPrice;
20:     }
```

In `struct MoveData`, `int32 tickLimit`, `int32 shiftAmount` and `uint128 firstBinId` can be placed together, as a result, 2 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they each occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, the 3 of them all can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
File: maverick-v1/contracts/models/Pool.sol
363:     struct MoveData {
364:         int32 tickLimit;
365:         uint8[2] kinds;
366:         int32 shiftAmount;
367:         BinMap.Active[] activeList;
368:         uint128 firstBinId;
```

#### Multiple address/ID mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address/ID to a struct, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.
